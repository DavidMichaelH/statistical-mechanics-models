# StatisticalMechanicsModels

## Introduction
Welcome to the statistical mechanics simulations repository! This is a growing collection of tools is designed to help you quickly and easily set up and run simulations for a variety of statistical mechanics models. Whether you're a seasoned researcher or a just getting started, this repository should have something to offer.

## How to use
To use these tools, we recommend running the simulations in Google Colab or a Jupyter notebook. This will allow you to easily interact with the simulations and see the results in real time.

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the Jupyter notebook or Colab notebook of your choice.
